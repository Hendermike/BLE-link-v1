# BLE and H-bridge DC motor controller hardware integration firmware

This is one of the building blocks of the Bike Tracker project. It is intended to run on the dedicated hardware implemented on the bikes.<br />

Specifically, it integrates HC-05 Bluetooth Low Energy modules, which interfaces with a dedicated Andorid application that calculates accelertion suggestions, with a DC motor controller that moves an ad-hoc haptic interface located on the bikes, communicating acceleration suggestions by gently scraping the cyclist's palm.
